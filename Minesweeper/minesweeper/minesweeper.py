# A Simple Wrapper for Difficulty Information
# As the program is designed to accept any number of mines, rows and columns, this allows for
# future expansion of the project. For our use-case, we have three pre-defined settings which are
# defined in the class `Difficulties`.
class Difficulty:

    def __init__(self, name, mines, rows, columns):
        self.name = name
        self.mines = mines
        self.rows = rows
        self.columns = columns


# A class which holds our pre-defined difficulties. These include:
# Easy: 9x9 board with 10 mines
# Medium: 16x16 board with 40 mines
# Hard: 30x16 board with 99 mines
# Should the criteria of the program change, this class can be easily modified to include new difficulties
# Note: function selectDifficulty will also need to be updated alongside this class.
class Difficulties:
    EASY = Difficulty(name="Easy", mines=10, rows=9, columns=9)
    MEDIUM = Difficulty(name="Medium", mines=40, rows=16, columns=16)
    HARD = Difficulty(name="Hard", mines=99, rows=16, columns=30)


# A holder class to prevent having None values in the initialisation of a variable. It can be True, False or Undefined
class TriState:

    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value

    def __eq__(self, other):
        return self.value == other.value


# A class which holds our three TriState values.
class TriStates:
    TRUE = TriState(True)
    FALSE = TriState(False)
    UNDEFINED = TriState(None)


# A class which holds the data required for the game to run. It includes:
# - The solution board
# - The player board
# - The difficulty
# The name of the player is not included in the board, as this data is processed after the game has finished
# to put it into the player_data file - so this logic remains in main().
# The class also includes methods which allow the player to interact with the board, such as flagging a cell or
# giving hints
